/**
  @page PAGE_PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA The Performance Schema main page
  MySQL PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA implementation.

  @section INTRO Introduction
  The PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA is a way to introspect the internal execution of
  the server at runtime.
  The performance schema focuses primarily on performance data,
  as opposed to the INFORMATION_SCHEMA whose purpose is to inspect metadata.

  From a user point of view, the performance schema consists of:
  - a dedicated database schema, named PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA,
  - SQL tables, used to query the server internal state or change
  configuration settings.

  From an implementation point of view, the performance schema is a dedicated
  Storage Engine which exposes data collected by 'Instrumentation Points'
  placed in the server code.

  @section INTERFACES Multiple interfaces

  The performance schema exposes many different interfaces,
  for different components, and for different purposes.

  @subsection INT_INSTRUMENTING Instrumenting interface

  All the data representing the server internal state exposed
  in the performance schema must be first collected:
  this is the role of the instrumenting interface.
  The instrumenting interface is a coding interface provided
  by implementors (of the performance schema) to implementors
  (of the server or server components).

  This interface is available to:
  - C implementations
  - C++ implementations
  - the core SQL layer (/sql)
  - the mysys library (/mysys)
  - MySQL plugins, including storage engines,
  - third party plugins, including third party storage engines.

  For details, see the @ref PAGE_INSTRUMENTATION_INTERFACE
  "instrumentation interface page".

  @subsection INT_COMPILING Compiling interface

  The implementation of the performance schema can be enabled or disabled at
  build time, when building MySQL from the source code.

  When building with the performance schema code, some compilation flags
  are available to change the default values used in the code, if required.

  For more details, see:
  @verbatim ./configure --help @endverbatim

  To compile with the performance schema:
  @verbatim ./configure --with-perfschema @endverbatim

  The implementation of all the compiling options is located in
  @verbatim ./storage/perfschema/plug.in @endverbatim

  @subsection INT_STARTUP Server startup interface

  The server startup interface consists of the "./mysqld ..."
  command line used to start the server.
  When the performance schema is compiled in the server binary,
  extra command line options are available.

  These extra start options allow the DBA to:
  - enable or disable the performance schema
  - specify some sizing parameters.

  To see help for the performance schema startup options, see:
  @verbatim ./sql/mysqld --verbose --help  @endverbatim

  The implementation of all the startup options is located in
  @verbatim ./sql/mysqld.cc, my_long_options[] @endverbatim

  @subsection INT_BOOTSTRAP Server bootstrap interface

  The bootstrap interface is a private interface exposed by
  the performance schema, and used by the SQL layer.
  Its role is to advertise all the SQL tables natively
  supported by the performance schema to the SQL server.
  The code consists of creating MySQL tables for the
  performance schema itself, and is used in './mysql --bootstrap'
  mode when a server is installed.

  The implementation of the database creation script is located in
  @verbatim ./scripts/mysql_system_tables.sql @endverbatim

  @subsection INT_CONFIG Runtime configuration interface

  When the performance schema is used at runtime, various configuration
  parameters can be used to specify what kind of data is collected,
  what kind of aggregations are computed, what kind of timers are used,
  what events are timed, etc.

  For all these capabilities, not a single statement or special syntax
  was introduced in the parser.
  Instead of new SQL statements, the interface consists of DML
  (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) against special "SETUP" tables.

  For example:
  @verbatim mysql> update performance_schema.SETUP_INSTRUMENTS
    set ENABLED='YES', TIMED='YES';
  Query OK, 234 rows affected (0.00 sec)
  Rows matched: 234  Changed: 234  Warnings: 0 @endverbatim

  @subsection INT_STATUS Internal audit interface

  The internal audit interface is provided to the DBA to inspect if the
  performance schema code itself is functioning properly.
  This interface is necessary because a failure caused while
  instrumenting code in the server should not cause failures in the
  MySQL server itself, so that the performance schema implementation
  never raises errors during runtime execution.

  This auditing interface consists of:
  @verbatim SHOW ENGINE PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA STATUS; @endverbatim
  It displays data related to the memory usage of the performance schema,
  as well as statistics about lost events, if any.

  The SHOW STATUS command is implemented in
  @verbatim ./storage/perfschema/pfs_engine_table.cc @endverbatim

  @subsection INT_QUERY Query interface

  The query interface is used to query the internal state of a running server.
  It is provided as SQL tables.

  For example:
  @verbatim mysql> select * from performance_schema.EVENTS_WAITS_CURRENT;
  @endverbatim

  @section DESIGN_PRINCIPLES Design principles

  @subsection PRINCIPLE_BEHAVIOR No behavior changes

  The primary goal of the performance schema is to measure (instrument) the
  execution of the server. A good measure should not cause any change
  in behavior.

  To achieve this, the overall design of the performance schema complies
  with the following very severe design constraints:

  The parser is unchanged. There are no new keywords, no new statements.
  This guarantees that existing applications will run the same way with or
  without the performance schema.

  All the instrumentation points return "void", there are no error codes.
  Even if the performance schema internally fails, execution of the server
  code will proceed.

  None of the instrumentation points allocate memory.
  All the memory used by the performance schema is pre-allocated at startup,
  and is considered "static" during the server life time.

  None of the instrumentation points use any pthread_mutex, pthread_rwlock,
  or pthread_cond (or platform equivalents).
  Executing the instrumentation point should not cause thread scheduling to
  change in the server.

  In other words, the implementation of the instrumentation points,
  including all the code called by the instrumentation points, is:
  - malloc free
  - mutex free
  - rwlock free

  TODO: All the code located in storage/perfschema is malloc free,
  but unfortunately the usage of LF_HASH introduces some memory allocation.
  This should be revised if possible, to use a lock-free,
  malloc-free hash code table.

  @subsection PRINCIPLE_PERFORMANCE No performance hit

  The instrumentation of the server should be as fast as possible.
  In cases when there are choices between:
  - doing some processing when recording the performance data
  in the instrumentation,
  - doing some processing when retrieving the performance data,

  priority is given in the design to make the instrumentation faster,
  pushing some complexity to data retrieval.

  As a result, some parts of the design, related to:
  - the setup code path,
  - the query code path,

  might appear to be sub-optimal.

  The criterion used here is to optimize primarily the critical path (data
  collection), possibly at the expense of non-critical code paths.

  @subsection PRINCIPLE_NOT_INTRUSIVE Unintrusive instrumentation

  For the performance schema in general to be successful, the barrier
  of entry for a developer should be low, so it's easy to instrument code.

  In particular, the instrumentation interface:
  - is available for C and C++ code (so it's a C interface),
  - does not require parameters that the calling code can't easily provide,
  - supports partial instrumentation (for example, instrumenting mutexes does
  not require that every mutex is instrumented)

  @subsection PRINCIPLE_EXTENDABLE Extendable instrumentation

  As the content of the performance schema improves,
  with more tables exposed and more data collected,
  the instrumentation interface will also be augmented
  to support instrumenting new concepts.
  Existing instrumentations should not be affected when additional
  instrumentation is made available, and making a new instrumentation
  available should not require existing instrumented code to support it.

  @subsection PRINCIPLE_VERSIONED Versioned instrumentation

  Given that the instrumentation offered by the performance schema will
  be augmented with time, when more features are implemented,
  the interface itself should be versioned, to keep compatibility
  with previous instrumented code.

  For example, after both plugin-A and plugin-B have been instrumented for
  mutexes, read write locks and conditions, using the instrumentation
  interface, we can anticipate that the instrumentation interface
  is expanded to support file based operations.

  Plugin-A, a file based storage engine, will most likely use the expanded
  interface and instrument its file usage, using the version 2
  interface, while Plugin-B, a network based storage engine, will not change
  its code and not release a new binary.

  When later the instrumentation interface is expanded to support network
  based operations (which will define interface version 3), the Plugin-B code
  can then be changed to make use of it.

  Note, this is just an example to illustrate the design concept here.
  Both mutexes and file instrumentation are already available
  since version 1 of the instrumentation interface.

  @subsection PRINCIPLE_DEPLOYMENT Easy deployment

  Internally, we might want every plugin implementation to upgrade the
  instrumented code to the latest available, but this will cause additional
  work and this is not practical if the code change is monolithic.

  Externally, for third party plugin implementors, asking implementors to
  always stay aligned to the latest instrumentation and make new releases,
  even when the change does not provide new functionality for them,
  is a bad idea.

  For example, requiring a network based engine to re-release because the
  instrumentation interface changed for file based operations, will create
  too many deployment issues.

  So, the performance schema implementation must support concurrently,
  in the same deployment, multiple versions of the instrumentation
  interface, and ensure binary compatibility with each version.

  In addition to this, the performance schema can be included or excluded
  from the server binary, using build time configuration options.

  Regardless, the following types of deployment are valid:
  - a server supporting the performance schema + a storage engine
  that is not instrumented
  - a server not supporting the performance schema + a storage engine
  that is instrumented

/**
  @page PAGE_INSTRUMENTATION_INTERFACE Performance schema: instrumentation interface page.
  MySQL performance schema instrumentation interface.

  @section INTRO Introduction

  The instrumentation interface consist of two layers:
  - a raw ABI (Application Binary Interface) layer, that exposes the primitive
  instrumentation functions exported by the performance schema instrumentation
  - an API (Application Programing Interface) layer,
  that provides many helpers for a developer instrumenting some code,
  to make the instrumentation as easy as possible.

  The ABI layer consists of:
@code
#include "mysql/psi/psi.h"
@endcode

  The API layer consists of:
@code
#include "mysql/psi/mutex_mutex.h"
#include "mysql/psi/mutex_file.h"
@endcode

  The first helper is for mutexes, rwlocks and conditions,
  the second for file io.

  The API layer exposes C macros and typedefs which will expand:
  - either to non-instrumented code, when compiled without the performance
  schema instrumentation
  - or to instrumented code, that will issue the raw calls to the ABI layer
  so that the implementation can collect data.

  Note that all the names introduced (for example, @c mysql_mutex_lock) do not
  collide with any other namespace.
  In particular, the macro @c mysql_mutex_lock is on purpose not named
  @c pthread_mutex_lock.
  This is to:
  - avoid overloading @c pthread_mutex_lock with yet another macro,
  which is dangerous as it can affect user code and pollute
  the end-user namespace.
  - allow the developer instrumenting code to selectively instrument
  some code but not all.

  @section PRINCIPLES Design principles

  The ABI part is designed as a facade, that exposes basic primitives.
  The expectation is that each primitive will be very stable over time,
  but the list will constantly grow when more instruments are supported.
  To support binary compatibility with plugins compiled with a different
  version of the instrumentation, the ABI itself is versioned
  (see @c PSI_v1, @c PSI_v2).

  For a given instrumentation point in the API, the basic coding pattern
  used is:
  - (a) If the performance schema is not initialized, do nothing
  - (b) If the object acted upon is not instrumented, do nothing
  - (c) otherwise, notify the performance schema of the operation
  about to be performed.

  The implementation of the instrumentation interface can:
  - decide that it is not interested by the event, and return NULL.
  In this context, 'interested' means whether the instrumentation for
  this object + event is turned on in the performance schema configuration
  (the SETUP_ tables).
  - decide that this event is to be instrumented.
  In this case, the instrumentation returns an opaque pointer,
  that acts as a listener.

  If a listener is returned, the instrumentation point then:
  - (d) invokes the "start" event method
  - (e) executes the instrumented code.
  - (f) invokes the "end" event method.

  If no listener is returned, only the instrumented code (e) is invoked.

  The following code fragment is annotated to show how in detail this pattern
  in implemented, when the instrumentation is compiled in:

@verbatim
static inline int mysql_mutex_lock(
  mysql_mutex_t *that, myf flags, const char *src_file, uint src_line)
{
  int result;
  struct PSI_mutex_locker *locker= NULL;

  ...... (a) .......... (b)
  if (PSI_server && that->m_psi)

  .......................... (c)
    if ((locker= PSI_server->get_thread_mutex_locker(that->m_psi,
                                                     PSI_MUTEX_LOCK)))

  ............... (d)
      PSI_server->start_mutex_wait(locker, src_file, src_line);

  ........ (e)
  result= pthread_mutex_lock(&that->m_mutex);

  if (locker)

  ............. (f)
    PSI_server->end_mutex_wait(locker, result);

  return result;
}
@endverbatim

  When the performance schema instrumentation is not compiled in,
  the code becomes simply a wrapper, expanded in line by the compiler:

@verbatim
static inline int mysql_mutex_lock(...)
{
  int result;

  ........ (e)
  result= pthread_mutex_lock(&that->m_mutex);

  return result;
}
@endverbatim
*/

/**
  @page PAGE_AGGREGATES Performance schema: the aggregates page.
  Performance schema aggregates.

  @section INTRO Introduction

  Aggregates tables are tables that can be formally defined as
  SELECT ... from EVENTS_WAITS_HISTORY_INFINITE ... group by 'group clause'.

  Each group clause defines a different kind of aggregate, and corresponds to
  a different table exposed by the performance schema.

  Aggregates can be either:
  - computed on the fly,
  - computed on demand, based on other available data.

  'EVENTS_WAITS_HISTORY_INFINITE' is a table that does not exist,
  the best approximation is EVENTS_WAITS_HISTORY_LONG.
  Aggregates computed on the fly in fact are based on EVENTS_WAITS_CURRENT,
  while aggregates computed on demand are based on other
  EVENTS_WAITS_SUMMARY_BY_xxx tables.

  To better understand the implementation itself, a bit of math is
  required first, to understand the model behind the code:
  the code is deceptively simple, the real complexity resides
  in the flyweight of pointers between various performance schema buffers.

  @section DIMENSION Concept of dimension

  An event measured by the instrumentation has many attributes.
  An event is represented as a data point P(x1, x2, ..., xN),
  where each x_i coordinate represents a given attribute value.

  Examples of attributes are:
  - the time waited
  - the object waited on
  - the instrument waited on
  - the thread that waited
  - the operation performed
  - per object or per operation additional attributes, such as spins,
  number of bytes, etc.

  Computing an aggregate per thread is fundamentally different from
  computing an aggregate by instrument, so the "_BY_THREAD" and
  "_BY_EVENT_NAME" aggregates are different dimensions,
  operating on different x_i and x_j coordinates.
  These aggregates are "orthogonal".

  @section PROJECTION Concept of projection

  A given x_i attribute value can convey either just one basic information,
  such as a number of bytes, or can convey implied information,
  such as an object fully qualified name.

  For example, from the value "test.t1", the name of the object schema
  "test" can be separated from the object name "t1", so that now aggregates
  by object schema can be implemented.

  In math terms, that corresponds to defining a function:
  F_i (x): x --> y
  Applying this function to our point P gives another point P':

  F_i (P):
  P(x1, x2, ..., x{i-1}, x_i, x{i+1}, ..., x_N)
  --> P' (x1, x2, ..., x{i-1}, f_i(x_i), x{i+1}, ..., x_N)

  That function defines in fact an aggregate !
  In SQL terms, this aggregate would look like the following table:

@verbatim
  CREATE VIEW EVENTS_WAITS_SUMMARY_BY_Func_i AS
  SELECT col_1, col_2, ..., col_{i-1},
         Func_i(col_i),
         COUNT(col_i),
         MIN(col_i), AVG(col_i), MAX(col_i), -- if col_i is a numeric value
         col_{i+1}, ..., col_N
         FROM EVENTS_WAITS_HISTORY_INFINITE
         group by col_1, col_2, ..., col_{i-1}, col{i+1}, ..., col_N.
@endverbatim

  Note that not all columns have to be included,
  in particular some columns that are dependent on the x_i column should
  be removed, so that in practice, MySQL's aggregation method tends to
  remove many attributes at each aggregation steps.

  For example, when aggregating wait events by object instances,
  - the wait_time and number_of_bytes can be summed,
  and sum(wait_time) now becomes an object instance attribute.
  - the source, timer_start, timer_end columns are not in the
  _BY_INSTANCE table, because these attributes are only
  meaningful for a wait.

  @section COMPOSITION Concept of composition

  Now, the "test.t1" --> "test" example was purely theory,
  just to explain the concept, and does not lead very far.
  Let's look at a more interesting example of data that can be derived
  from the row event.

  An event creates a transient object, PFS_wait_locker, per operation.
  This object's life cycle is extremely short: it's created just
  before the start_wait() instrumentation call, and is destroyed in
  the end_wait() call.

  The wait locker itself contains a pointer to the object instance
  waited on.
  That allows to implement a wait_locker --> object instance projection,
  with m_target.
  The object instance life cycle depends on _init and _destroy calls
  from the code, such as mysql_mutex_init()
  and mysql_mutex_destroy() for a mutex.

  The object instance waited on contains a pointer to the object class,
  which is represented by the instrument name.
  That allows to implement an object instance --> object class projection.
  The object class life cycle is permanent, as instruments are loaded in
  the server and never removed.

  The object class is named in such a way
  (for example, "wait/sync/mutex/sql/LOCK_open",
  "wait/io/file/maria/data_file) that the component ("sql", "maria")
  that it belongs to can be inferred.
  That allows to implement an object class --> server component projection.

  Back to math again, we have, for example for mutexes:

  F1 (l) : PFS_wait_locker l --> PFS_mutex m = l->m_target.m_mutex

  F1_to_2 (m) : PFS_mutex m --> PFS_mutex_class i = m->m_class

  F2_to_3 (i) : PFS_mutex_class i --> const char *component =
                                        substring(i->m_name, ...)

  Per components aggregates are not implemented, this is just an illustration.

  F1 alone defines this aggregate:

  EVENTS_WAITS_HISTORY_INFINITE --> EVENTS_WAITS_SUMMARY_BY_INSTANCE
  (or MUTEX_INSTANCE)

  F1_to_2 alone could define this aggregate:

  EVENTS_WAITS_SUMMARY_BY_INSTANCE --> EVENTS_WAITS_SUMMARY_BY_EVENT_NAME

  Alternatively, using function composition, with
  F2 = F1_to_2 o F1, F2 defines:

  EVENTS_WAITS_HISTORY_INFINITE --> EVENTS_WAITS_SUMMARY_BY_EVENT_NAME

  Likewise, F_2_to_3 defines:

  EVENTS_WAITS_SUMMARY_BY_EVENT_NAME --> EVENTS_WAITS_SUMMARY_BY_COMPONENT

  and F3 = F_2_to_3 o F_1_to_2 o F1 defines:

  EVENTS_WAITS_HISTORY_INFINITE --> EVENTS_WAITS_SUMMARY_BY_COMPONENT

  What has all this to do with the code ?

  Functions (or aggregates) such as F_3 are not implemented as is.
  Instead, they are decomposed into F_2_to_3 o F_1_to_2 o F1,
  and each intermediate aggregate is stored into an internal buffer.
  This allows to support every F1, F2, F3 aggregates from shared
  internal buffers, where computation already performed to compute F2
  is reused when computing F3.

  @section OBJECT_GRAPH Object graph

  In terms of object instances, or records, pointers between
  different buffers define an object instance graph.

  For example, assuming the following scenario:
  - A mutex class "M" is instrumented, the instrument name
  is "wait/sync/mutex/sql/M"
  - This mutex instrument has been instantiated twice,
  mutex instances are noted M-1 and M-2
  - Threads T-A and T-B are locking mutex instance M-1
  - Threads T-C and T-D are locking mutex instance M-2

  The performance schema will record the following data:
  - EVENTS_WAITS_CURRENT has 4 rows, one for each mutex locker
  - EVENTS_WAITS_SUMMARY_BY_INSTANCE shows 2 rows, for M-1 and M-2
  - EVENTS_WAITS_SUMMARY_BY_EVENT_NAME shows 1 row, for M

  The graph of structures will look like:

@verbatim
  PFS_wait_locker (T-A, M-1) ----------
                                      |
                                      v
                                 PFS_mutex (M-1)
                                 - m_wait_stat    ------------
                                      ^                      |

                                                        - m_wait_stat
  PFS_wait_locker (T-C, M-2) ----------                      ^
                                      |                      |
                                      v                      |

  EVENTS_WAITS_CURRENT ..._SUMMARY_BY_INSTANCE ..._SUMMARY_BY_EVENT_NAME
@endverbatim

  @section ON_THE_FLY On the fly aggregates

  'On the fly' aggregates are computed during the code execution.
  This is necessary because the data the aggregate is based on is volatile,
  and can not be kept indefinitely.

  With on the fly aggregates:
  - the writer thread does all the computation
  - the reader thread accesses the result directly

  This model is to be avoided if possible, due to the overhead
  caused when instrumenting code.

  @section HIGHER_LEVEL Higher level aggregates

  'Higher level' aggregates are implemented on demand only.
  The code executing a SELECT from the aggregate table is
  collecting data from multiple internal buffers to produce the result.

  With higher level aggregates:
  - the reader thread does all the computation
  - the writer thread has no overhead.

  @section MIXED Mixed level aggregates

  The 'Mixed' model is a compromise between 'On the fly' and 'Higher level'
  aggregates, for internal buffers that are not permanent.

  While an object is present in a buffer, the higher level model is used.
  When an object is about to be destroyed, statistics are saved into
  a 'parent' buffer with a longer life cycle, to follow the on the fly model.

  With mixed aggregates:
  - the reader thread does a lot of complex computation,
  - the writer thread has minimal overhead, on destroy events.

  @section IMPL_WAIT Implementation for waits aggregates

  For waits, the tables that contains aggregated wait data are:
  - EVENTS_WAITS_SUMMARY_BY_ACCOUNT_BY_EVENT_NAME
  - EVENTS_WAITS_SUMMARY_BY_HOST_BY_EVENT_NAME
  - EVENTS_WAITS_SUMMARY_BY_INSTANCE
  - EVENTS_WAITS_SUMMARY_BY_THREAD_BY_EVENT_NAME
  - EVENTS_WAITS_SUMMARY_BY_USER_BY_EVENT_NAME
  - EVENTS_WAITS_SUMMARY_GLOBAL_BY_EVENT_NAME
  - FILE_SUMMARY_BY_EVENT_NAME
  - FILE_SUMMARY_BY_INSTANCE
  - OBJECTS_SUMMARY_GLOBAL_BY_TYPE

  The instrumented code that generates waits events consist of:
  - mutexes (mysql_mutex_t)
  - rwlocks (mysql_rwlock_t)
  - conditions (mysql_cond_t)
  - file io (MYSQL_FILE)
  - table io
  - table lock

  The flow of data between aggregates tables varies for each instrumentation.

  How to read this diagram:
  - events that occur during the instrumented code execution are noted with numbers,
  as in [1]. Code executed by these events has an impact on overhead.
  - events that occur during TRUNCATE TABLE operations are noted with numbers,
  followed by "-RESET", as in [4-RESET].
  Code executed by these events has no impact on overhead,
  since they are executed by independent monitoring sessions.
  - events that occur when a reader extracts data from a performance schema table
  are noted with letters, as in [A]. The name of the table involved,
  and the method that builds a row are documented. Code executed by these events
  has no impact on the instrumentation overhead. Note that the table
  implementation may pull data from different buffers.
  - nominal code paths are in plain lines. A "nominal" code path corresponds to
  cases where the performance schema buffers are sized so that no records are lost.
  - degenerated code paths are in dotted lines. A "degenerated" code path corresponds
  to edge cases where parent buffers are full, which forces the code to aggregate to
  grand parents directly.

  Table EVENTS_WAITS_SUMMARY_BY_INSTANCE is a 'on the fly' aggregate,
  because the data is collected on the fly by (1) and stored into a buffer,
  pfs_mutex. The table implementation [B] simply reads the results directly
  from this buffer.

  Table EVENTS_WAITS_SUMMARY_GLOBAL_BY_EVENT_NAME is a 'mixed' aggregate,
  because some data is collected on the fly (1),
  some data is preserved with (2) at a later time in the life cycle,
  and two different buffers pfs_mutex and pfs_mutex_class are used to store the
  statistics collected. The table implementation [C] is more complex, since
  it reads from two buffers pfs_mutex and pfs_mutex_class.
